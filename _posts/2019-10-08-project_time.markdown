This last week has been a very intense week for me. I have been hesitating every day on starting my project. The hardest part of getting started has been me doubting myself and not knowing what to do to get started. The easiest part was coming up with my topic since I went with something that I was really interested in. I have a big hobby for playing basketball so I chose to make my application about my favorite basketball team; The Golden State Warriors. I finally chose to just take the leap and get started even if my code gets pretty messy. I never really have time to watch the games so keeping up with their stats is very important to me.  My goal is to display all of the players stats from preseason 2019-20.
